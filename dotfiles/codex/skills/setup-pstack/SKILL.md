# Setup pstack

Write `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, a per-role model override sheet you include from your global `CLAUDE.md`. Each pstack skill names a default model inline; the override sheet is the layer that adapts those defaults to the models you actually have access to.

**Platform note.** On Codex, the override sheet is `~/.codex/pstack-models.md`, the slugs are your Codex models (for example `gpt-5.5`) not `claude-*`, and you load it by adding the sheet's contents to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (Codex has no `@`-include into a rules file). The role rows in step 5 are identical; only the slugs, the file path, and the load mechanism change. Detect Codex slugs from `~/.codex/config.toml` (`model = ...`) plus whatever the user confirms. See [`codex-tools.md`](../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md).

Claude Code has no auto-applied "rules" mechanism like Cursor's `.mdc`. Inclusion is explicit: the user adds a line to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (or their project `CLAUDE.md`) such as:

```text
@~/.claude/pstack-models.md
```

so the file is loaded as context for every session.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Enumerate the model slugs you can pass to an `Agent` subagent in this session — that is the dependable source. The currently available Claude models and the default panel are listed in [Models](#models) below; the quad is chosen for cross-family, cross-tier diversity, and the single-role default stays out of the panels because it already covers the single-model roles. Ask the user to confirm or paste any additional slugs they want available. Never write a real slug you have not confirmed is available. The aliases `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not detected slugs; both mean the role runs on the parent session's model, which the `Agent` call expresses by omitting `model`.

### 2. Load current state

The default role-to-model mapping is the rule shape shown in step 5 below. If `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` already exists, read it and treat its values as the current choices. Otherwise start from those defaults.

### 3. Map and confirm

Show every role with its current model, marking any real slug not in the detected set as needing a choice. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto` as the options. Prefer `AskUserQuestion` over free text. For panel roles (how critics, arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose model family differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Validate

Every real slug written must be in the detected set; `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen real slug is not available, stop and ask again. An override pointing at a model the user cannot use breaks every delegation that reads it.

### 5. Write the override sheet

Write `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` with the shape below. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent.

```markdown
# pstack model configuration

Per-role model overrides for pstack skills. Each pstack SKILL.md names its defaults in a Models section; the values here override those defaults. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default. A value of `inherit-parent` or `auto` runs that role on the parent session's model (the `Agent` call omits `model`); an alias entry in a panel list still counts toward that panel's fan-out.

### 6. Wire it in

If `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` does not already include `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, append the `@~/.claude/pstack-models.md` line so it loads on every session. If the user prefers project scope, add the include to the project's `CLAUDE.md` instead.

### 7. Confirm

Tell the user where the override was written and how it loads (via the `@` include in CLAUDE.md). Re-running this skill updates the override sheet.
